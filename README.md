# Age-Driven Disparities in COVID-19 Fatality Rates â€“ A Toronto Perspective

## Overview of the Project

This repository contains all the files and documentation for the paper. The paper presents an analysis of COVID-19 cases in Toronto, emphasizing the disproportionate impact on different age groups. Leveraging data from the City of Toronto's Open Data Library, my analysis sheds light on the severity of outcomes, with a particular focus on the vulnerability of older individuals.

## File Structure
The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## LLM Usage
